# YWAM-DTS-Data-Logger
This is an app that helps the user view information that was inputted about YWAM's (Youth With a Mission) DTS's (Discipleship Training Schools). I used personally used this web app to aid me in writing down and viewing information about the schools to help me choose which school I may want to attend. This web app is very bare bones and has minimal styling but it works.  

<h1>App functionality</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Log information about YWAM DTS's and the app displays it in a readable manner.</li>
  <li>Edit, Update, and Delete DTS's information</li>
</ul>

<h1>Functionality Yet to Add</h1>
<p>This web app is still a work in progress and there are things that I have yet to add to it:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Users: Ability to have multiple users and their saved schools.</li>
  <li>Better Error Handling</li>
</ul>
